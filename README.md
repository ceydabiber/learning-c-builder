<h1>Learning C++ Builder</h1>
This repository is where I explore C++ Builder by working on GUI projects inspired by tutorials, particularly from CodeBeauty's Youtube Playlist. While I follow along with the tutorials, I take things a step further by adding my own features and customizations, making the applications unique and a true part of my learning journey.

<h2>Project 1: Shopping List Application</h2>
A simple and interactive shopping list application built using C++ Builder. The app allows users to:

* Add Items: Type an item into the list.
* Strike Through Items: Click on an item to mark it as "done."
* Clear All Items: Reset the list with a single click.

> This project was inspired by a [To-Do App tutorial](https://youtu.be/FxQTXyR4mjs?si=JMzFywNS6dVXPtAg) from [CodeBeauty's C++ Builder Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxQTXyR4mjs&list=PL43pGnjiVwgQakzRxpt2amqN9f7-tRtc_). While the tutorial served as a starting point, I adapted the concept into a shopping list and added features to make it more functional and unique.

<h2>Project 2: Pop Quiz Application</h2>
A fun and interactive pop quiz application with multiple-choice questions, built using C++ Builder. The application features:

* Dynamic Questions: Three questions loaded with their respective answers and a system to evaluate correctness.
* Scoring System: Each question awards different points based on its difficulty.
* Restart Quiz: A restart button allows users to retake the quiz at any point.
* Answer Feedback: After selecting an answer and hitting the "Confirm" button, the app shows whether the answer was correct or not.
* Improved User Flow: A timer introduces a brief delay between questions, during which the "Confirm" button is disabled and displays "Wait." At the end of the quiz, the button updates to "Game Over."
